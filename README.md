# Healthcare-prediction-on-diabetic-patient

## Introduction
This project aims to predict diabetes in patients using relevant health indicators. The goal is to create a reliable and accurate machine learning model that healthcare providers can use for proactive intervention. The primary focus is on early detection of diabetes, which can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn

## Configuration
Ensure that the dataset (**health care diabetes.csv**) is placed in the project directory. The data preprocessing steps are included in the Jupyter notebook (**Healthcare_Prediction.ipynb**), providing details on handling missing values, outliers, and feature selection.

## Models and Algorithms
#### The project employs several machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The models are trained on the preprocessed data to predict diabetes outcomes.

## How to Use
Follow these steps to utilize the Healthcare Prediction on Diabetic Patients project:
1. **Clone the Repository :** Clone this repository to your local machine using ' git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git ' .
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook :** Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the **Healthcare_Prediction.ipynb** file. This notebook guides you through the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training processes.
3. **Run the Notebook :** Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each code cell. The notebook will walk you through the steps of handling missing values, treating outliers, exploring data, and training various machine learning models for predicting diabetes in patients.
